Natural Language Processing to Motivate Expressive Language Development

Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a neurological and developmental disorder that impairs social communication and social interaction with varying levels of severity.
Expressive visual supports that can vary from colored pictures to written words have been shown to help improve confidence and encourage independence, however, these tools do not
focus on developing natural language expression for the users. Combining the natural tendency of people with ASD to be attracted to technology, and the ability for hand-held technology
(tables, phones, etc.) to provide near-instantaneous feedback, and thus gratification, from spoken input, a tool that promotes expressive language using hand-held technology is desired to be developed.
Project: We will develop software that uses natural language processing to determine visual, audible, and tactile output for a tablet. The desired level of interaction is for children 
with ASD with limited expressive language skills. Initial development will be for individually recognized words to develop the primary output.
Input: Audible dialog will be the primary means of gathering input for the desired output
Output: Digital representations of recognized spoken words, including appropriate auditory and tactile output.
